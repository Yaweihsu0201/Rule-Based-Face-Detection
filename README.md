# Face Detection with Skin Segmentation and Facial Landmark Triplet Scoring

This project implements a face detection pipeline inspired by the method proposed in:

> Ke-Jie Liao 廖科傑, "運用輪廓色彩和五官的人臉偵測技術 Face Detection by Outline, Color, and Facial Features", 2010.

This project implements a face detection pipeline based on skin segmentation, ellipse matching, facial feature maps, geometric filtering, and machine learning-based triplet scoring.

Compared with the original method, this implementation includes several modifications, including:

- Replace color-based skin filtering with Deep Learning method
- Add several more eye-mouth features into consideration
- Select the most likely facial landmark triplet using geometric constraints and a trained Random Forest classifier.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to detect faces in an image by identifying the best combination of:

- left eye
- right eye
- mouth

within candidate face ellipses.

The final output visualizes the detected facial structure by drawing:

- the fitted face ellipse
- detected eye and mouth points
- lines connecting the eyes and mouth

## Method

The detection pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. **Skin Segmentation**  
   A trained U-Net model is used to predict skin regions from the input image.

2. **Ellipse Matching**  
   Face-like elliptical regions are extracted from the predicted skin mask.

3. **Eye Map and Mouth Map Generation**  
   Eye and mouth response maps are generated from the RGB image.

4. **Candidate Extraction**  
   Local maxima from the eye map and mouth map are selected as eye and mouth candidates.

5. **Geometric Filtering**  
   Candidate triplets are filtered using facial geometry rules, such as:
   - the two eyes should have a reasonable distance
   - the eye midpoint should lie close to the face major axis
   - the mouth should be roughly aligned with the face major axis
   - the eye line should be approximately perpendicular to the eye-mouth direction

6. **Triplet Scoring**  
   A Random Forest classifier scores each valid triplet based on normalized geometric features.

7. **Best Triplet Selection**  
   The highest-scoring triplet across all candidate ellipses is selected as the final detection result.

## Pipeline Details

### Skin Segmentation

The skin segmentation model predicts a binary or probability mask of skin regions. This mask is used to locate possible face areas.

### Ellipse Matching

Connected skin regions are analyzed and approximated using ellipses. Each ellipse is treated as a possible face candidate.

### Candidate Detection

Eye and mouth response maps are computed from the input image. For each ellipse, local maxima inside the ellipse are selected as possible facial feature candidates.

### Geometric Triplet Filtering

For each ellipse, combinations of two eye candidates and one mouth candidate are tested using geometry-based constraints.

The geometry module checks whether the triplet forms a reasonable facial structure.

### Random Forest Triplet Scoring

After geometric filtering, each valid triplet is converted into a feature vector. These features include:

- normalized eye-to-eye distance
- normalized eye-to-mouth distance
- mouth-to-eye-midpoint distance
- relative coordinates inside the ellipse
- angles between facial axes
- ellipse aspect ratio
- eye map and mouth map response values

A trained Random Forest classifier predicts the confidence score of each triplet. The best-scoring triplet is selected as the final result.

## Future Improvements

Possible future improvements include:

- Support batch processing for an entire image folder
- Add evaluation metrics for face detection accuracy
- Improve candidate extraction efficiency
- Replace manual thresholding with adaptive thresholds
- Train a stronger triplet scoring model
- Compare performance with modern face detectors such as MTCNN, RetinaFace, or YOLO-based detectors
- Add support for multiple face detection in one image
